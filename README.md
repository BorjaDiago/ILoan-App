# ILoan-App
Eloan will be an Android application that will allow the user to perform and manage
loans of different types of items (objects), to different people, and carry a
control over their status. The application will allow friends to register,
include objects in the library and generate loans, indicating both a date of
beginning of the loan as an end date for its return. With a simple and intuitive design it is intended to ensure that the user can efficiently and quickly manage exhaustive control over the battery of items that the application contains in its database.

The following image shows the relationship diagram that represents the
data model used in the Eloan application.
